        <p>
            Graphic design is so broad and exciting, no I donâ€™t sit at a desk all day and just make logos or
            websites. I have a more hands on approach, getting deep and gritty into a subject matter. Finding
            out all there is to know about something in order to interpret the information as best as I can.
            Research is a big part of my practice, I get to be a scientist for a few hours or be in the minds of
            a child. My perspective changes constantly.
